## Requirements

1. A computer with photoshop & required typefaces installed (the presentation mac studio, for example).
    - Calibre & Louize are required for the thumbnail. These can be found in the dropbox under **Graphics for Announcements ETC** / **Church Logos and Graphics** / **Typefaces**
2. The service's date in the following format: `MMM D[Suffix], YYYY`
    - **Jan 1st, 2024** for example
3. Name of the sermon for the service.
4. Color of the template. Options include:
    - Gray (Special occasions only)
    - Blue
    - Yellow
    - Green
    - Red
5. A background for the thumbnail (selected with series, see below). [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) is a great resource for grabbing free high-resolution images for the thumbnail.
6. Whether the service's sermon is in a series.
!!! warning
    
    All sermons in a series must use the same color & background. If there is not a sermon series, the background & color should be updated every month. In the case that a sermon series is introduced in the middle of a month that didn't otherwise have one, a new background & color combo should be created for that series.

!!! note

    Unless specified otherwise, the sermon series title during advent is "Advent".
## Creating the thumbnail

### Open the file

1. Open **Finder** -> Go to **Dropbox/Youtube Thumbnails** -> Open **template_yt.psd** in photoshop.

    !!! tip
        
        If the workspace has been changed, it may be difficult to find items. Reset the workspace to default: Go to **Window** in the top bar -> Click **Workspace** -> Select **Essentials (default)** and then go back to the same menu and Click **Reset Essentials**.

1. Locate the layers pane in the lower right-hand corner of the window (Collapse all the folders to make it easier to view).

  <figcaption>Layers pane</figcaption>
</figure>
    
### Set the sermon series visibility

1. If there is a sermon series, make sure that the eye next to the folder titled **Sermon Series** is visible. Click the eye to toggle visibility on/off. If there is no sermon series, make sure the visibility is disabled by clicking the eye.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Sermon series visibility](/assets/guides/video-production/sermon_series_visibility.png){ width="400" }
  <figcaption>Sermon series visibility</figcaption>
</figure>

### Set the color of the template

1. Expand the **Date** folder. You will see five layers named **Date Background (%Color%)**.

    !!! note
        
        There should only be only of these layers visible at a time. Refer to **Set the sermon series visibility** (above) about how to change visiblity.

1. Only make the selected color layer visible. For example, if the selected theme color is blue, then make sure that only **Date Background (Blue)** is selected.

  ![Date background color (blue example)](/assets/guides/video-production/date_background_blue.png){ width="400" }
